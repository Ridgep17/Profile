<br>Student Email: S3889058@student.rmit.edu <br>

<br>I was born in Canberra, Australia and have lived here for my entire life. I completed my education in the public school system, where i made the decision to further my education at the Canberra Institute Of Technology. It was there that i studied a Diploma Of Sports Development. After this i enrolled at the University Of Canberra, Where I started a Bachelor Of Sport And Exercise Science, However I decided that it was not what I wanted to do for a living. I made the switch to studying to  a a Bachelor Of Information Technology at RMIT, And i Have enjoyed it. <br>Something that others often find interesting about me is that I am Ambiddextrous.

                      <br><h2>Interest in IT:</h2>

              Information Technology is diverse and not limited to just fixing computers. I am extremely interested in IT as it is now all around us and is nearly in everything we do in life. It is also one of the most flexible industries as you always have technology at your fingertips which means whether you are at home or in an office you can still do your job. One of my closest friends was explaining how much he enjoyed his job, and I was looking for a change of path in my studies. The flexibility and the changing landscape of IT was enticing, and with all my friend’s stories about his job, moving into IT seemed like the kind of change that would be good for me.

I chose to complete my studies at RMIT as it had a good reputation and was very flexible to my work schedule. Flexibility with my studies was a major factor, as many universities do not offer that. Being able to study online was also important. I am from Canberra and have limited opportunities to study in a way that suites my current schedule, so having access to RMIT through Open Universities Australia was an opportunity that was hard to say no to.

I would like to expand my knowledge and have a greater understanding of how much Information Technology means and how I can use it more to my advantage. I have a keen interest in being able to explore the many aspects of the field of Information Technology. At the moment I do not necessarily have a particular area that I can see myself working in, so I am expecting that as I progress through my studies at RMIT that I will learn enough about each area, and what I can expect in my future career.

                        Personally, the results do not mean too much to me as the results can differ quite a bit each time that you do them. But in saying that certain aspects of the results do seem quite accurate in terms of my personality and some of the traits it thinks I exhibit.<br>

<br>Some of the results indicate that I can be quite assertive and that will not always be a good thing, which means I will need to adapt depending on the personalities of the team so that we can be efficient and work well as a team.<br>

<br>When deciding on teams in a work environment it is paramount to have the right people working together so putting people who have similar personalities or personalities that wont clash will be beneficial to a work environment

  <br> Project Idea <br>

<br>Overview:<br>
<br>
The Project that we are planning to undertake is to design an app that will assist you pick an appropriate gift for a family member, friend or even a secret Santa gift for a colleague. The app itself will be designed with the user in mind. This means that the app will be user friendly and incredibly simple so that it is accessible to users of all generations, so that it will only take a few minutes to have the best gift suggestions for whoever you are buying for, at your fingertips.<br>
<br>Motivation:<br>
<br>As like many people I struggle to find the right gifts or even a decent gift to give to my friends and family. We are going to develop an app that will help you decide what kind of gifts to give to your loved ones and ensure that whatever get them they will love and cherish. There is big market for an app like this as someone who as spent hours searching for things that my loved one might like and getting stuck with too many choices of getting drained with having spent so long looking at options, this will give an efficient and inexpensive option to help many people.<br>
<br>Description:<br>
<br>This app would of consist of features which you can manually enter such as gender, age and likes and dislikes. That way the app can analyse likes and dislikes of the age range and gender of the person you trying to buy a present for. This means the app can find out buying patterns of people like who you are buying for. Another feature would be pairing, with this the person you are buying for can pair to your app this way it has instant access to what that person has been buying or even what they have been searching or putting in their Christmas wish list. The app will also have function where you can add a price range as you may be on a budget but still want to get the perfect gift so we need the app to accessible to everyone and having a built-in budget calculator for the gift will help. Once the app has analysed the following data it will give a list of the five best options to buy. The settings of the app can be changed to suit your needs, such as if you are buying for a couple or family all you need to do is go into the settings and change them to what suits your needs. The app could have some obstacles such as privacy concerns that would need to be expressly stated in the terms and conditions. Another issue could be errors in how the app is designed such as the suggestions that app gives may not be completely accurate so testing to a big sample group during the testing stages will be a must to ensure that we are getting as accurate a result as possible.<br>

<br>Technologies:<br>

<br>For this Project there is not much hardware that is needed mainly software, but we do need a up to date computer with a high core processor and a good amount of RAM other than that there is not much other hardware needed at this point. As for software we can use Android Studio or like start with as some of the code or similar may already have been written that we can tailor for our needs. We can also use open-source tools such as python and Mozilla to name a few if it suits the needs of the project.<br>
<br>Skills Required:<br>
<br>UI Design and Language Programming skills are the most important skills required to help design this app and finding people with the skills to help design the app should not be too difficult as there are so many people in the field but making sure the costs stay low and economical could be a challenge. Hardware is not a huge issue butting making sure we a have a computer that has a high processor, and a lot of RAM will help the process go a lot smoother as having an outdated computer will make the process go slower and certain functions may not be compatible with an old and slow machine.<br>
<br>Outcome:<br>
<br>If the project is successful, we will be helping people with a remarkably simple and eloquent solution. No need to spend endless hours searching for the perfect gift. We give you the best options based on data and manually entered details to help you achieve the perfect gift for everyone. This means every Christmas or birthday you won’t have to worry about whether you have gotten the right gift or be anxious you can be confident and enjoy the moment.
